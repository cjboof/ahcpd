Ahcpd is a daemon for configuring an IPv6 network using the Ad-Hoc
Configuration Protocol (AHCP).  AHCP is designed for wireless mesh
networks, where IPv6 autoconfiguration and DHCP do not work, but may
also be used on wired networks.

AHCP autoconfiguration happens in two stages.  First, a block of
stateless autoconfiguration data is flooded throughout the network;
this contains enough information to set up IPv6 routing.  Then, AHCP
peers contact a stateful AHCP server using IPv6 unicast in order to
get the information necessary to configure IPv4 routing.


Installation
************

  $ make
  # make install

If compiling for OpenWRT, you will probably want to say something like

  $ make CC=mipsel-linux-gcc PLATFORM_DEFINES='-march=mips32'


Configuring a network to use AHCP
*********************************

1. Choose a network prefix
--------------------------

You will need to choose a /64 network prefix for your AHCP network.
If you have a spare native or 6to4 /64 prefix, use that.  If you
don't, you can use the included utility `ahcp-generate-address'' to
choose one randomly for you:

  $ ahcp-generate-address -p -s -r
  fde6:20f5:c9ac:358::

2. Generate an AHCP configuration
---------------------------------

An AHCP configuration is a blob of binary data and is generated with
ahcp-generate.  For example

  $ ahcp-generate -p fde6:20f5:c9ac:358:: -P babel -n fde6:20f5:c9ac:358::1 \
        > ahcp.dat

If you intend to run a stateful AHCP server, you should add its address:

  $ ahcp-generate -p fde6:20f5:c9ac:358:: -P babel -n fde6:20f5:c9ac:358::1 \
        -s fde6:20f5:c9ac:358::1 > ahcp.dat

3. Configure an authoritative AHCP peer
---------------------------------------

You will need to configure at least one host on your AHCP network to
be an ``authoritative'' AHCP peer.  Multiple authoritative peers may
be configured for redundancy; an AHCP network will survive the loss of
all authoritative peers for no more than one hour by default (this
can be changed with the ``-e'' flag to ahcpd).

On each authoritative AHCP peer, run

  # ahcpd -a /path/to/ahcp.dat eth1

where eth1 is the interface on which you want the peer to participate
in the AHCP protocol.  Multiple interfaces can be included, in which
case the peer will provide AHCP configuration on all the interfaces.

By default, the authoritative peers will be configured by AHCP just
like the other ones.  You may want to keep the authoritative peers
network configuration unchanged (for example because they use static
routing); in that case, please see the use of the `-c' flag below.

4. Set up an AHCP stateful server
---------------------------------

The AHCP stateful server is responsible for giving out IPv4 addresses
to clients.  It should run on a stable machine with a reliable disk,
where it can store its lease database.

  # mkdir /var/lib/ahcp-leases
  # ahcpd -S 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.254 /var/lib/ahcp-leases eth0

If the stateful server is also an authoritative peer, you should add
the -a flag:

  # ahcpd -a /path/to/ahcp.dat \
          -S 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.254 /var/lib/ahcp-leases \
          eth0

5. Run AHCP on your other hosts
-------------------------------

On each AHCP peer, run

  # ahcpd eth1

where eth1 is the interface on which you want your peer to participate
in the AHCP protocol.  Multiple interfaces can be included, in which
case the peer will forward configuration information between interfaces.

6. Configuring non-standard peers
---------------------------------

Some AHCP peers will need to use a non-standard configuration, for
example because they are Internet gateways.  You can configure a peer
manually, then tell ahcpd to not touch the network configuration by
using the ``-c'' flag:

  # ahcpd -c /path/to/dummy-config.sh eth1

If you are using OLSR, you can request that ahcpd add sections to the
olsrd configuration file by creating a file

  /etc/ahcp/ahcp-olsrd.conf

For example, on an Internet gateway this file will typically contain

  Hna6 { :: 0 }
  Willingness 6

If you are using Babel, you can add random flags to the invocation of
the babel daemon by creating a file

  /etc/ahcp/ahcp-babel-options

For example, you may specify the kernel priority of the routes installed by
Babel by specifying something like

  -k 20

You can also specify any interfaces that you want to participate in
the Babel protocol but not the AHCP protocol by listing them in the file

  /etc/ahcp/ahcp-babel-interfaces


Extending AHCP
**************

AHCP can currently only provide information to configure static
routing and dynamic routing using either OLSR or Babel.  In addition,
it is only able to carry a subset of possible configuration data
(notably prefix information and DNS and NTP servers).

However, AHCP was designed to be an extensible protocol, and could
conceivably be extended to carry all sorts of static configuration
information (i.e. information that does not depend on the host it is
sent to).  Please contact me if you want to define additional AHCP
options.
